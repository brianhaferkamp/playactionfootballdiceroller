To use the dice roller, click on the Roll button and get the top roll values. These are the main roll values you'll need for each play from scrimmage. To get a roll for the bottom roll values click on the label (d6, d10, etc.) and get the roll value. These can be clicked individually to get individual dice rolls. When you click on the Roll button the bottom values will reset until needed. To change the scoreboard click on the + or - to increase or decrease the score by 1 point.

This application is mobile optimized but will look good on any screen. It works for any web-enabled device. When you first open the link to the app you'll download the files to run the application. It doesn't require continuous web access so if you lose your signal while playing the app should still work. Resetting the page will reset the scoreboard.
